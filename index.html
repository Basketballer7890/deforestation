    <h1>Research Question:</h1>
    <p>What is the impact of deforestation on the planet and animal life in the Amazon rainforest?</p>
    <img src="./static/deforestation_img.jpg">
    <p>I have chosen this question because I want to inform people about deforestation and how it can harm the plant, animal and humans. <br> Deforestation is import to inform people about because it kills almost 10,000 animals a day and <br> releases tons of carbon dioxide a day because we humans cut trees down for our uses. </p>
